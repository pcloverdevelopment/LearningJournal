# History and Story of Data

## So what exactly is a database?
> *"it's a collection of data, a method for accessing and manipulating that data"*

### Fun tid bit
Ever wonder why databases are represented graphically using that cylindrical thingy? It's because original memory were comprised of [these weird drums](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2822650/why-is-a-database-always-represented-with-a-cylinder).

### Some Acronyms Clarified
DataBase Management System (*DBMS*)
: Software that is used to manage the database via instructions

Relational DataBase Management System (*RDBMS*)
: Same as above, but for a relational (1 of the 5 types of DBs) database

Structured Query Language (*SQL*)
: The tool (language) we use to interact with a (R)DBMS
