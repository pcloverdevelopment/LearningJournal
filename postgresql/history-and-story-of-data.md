Ever wonder why databases are represented graphically using that cylindrical thingy? It's because original memory were comprised of [these weird drums](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2822650/why-is-a-database-always-represented-with-a-cylinder).

### Some Acronyms Clarified
>**D**ata**B**ase **M**anagement **S**ystem (*DBMS*):
Software that is used to manage the database via instructions

> **R**elational **D**ata**B**ase **M**anagement **S**ystem (*RDBMS*):
Same as above, but for a relational (1 of the 5 types of DBs) database
