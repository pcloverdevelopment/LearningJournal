# SQL Terminology

> **Relation Schema**

> **Tables** are the representations of an object we are modeling, it has a name, columns to represent types of data, and rows that contain records or entries within the table. It is the container of our pieces of data, and is kind of like an excel spreadsheet.

> **Columns/Attributes** help us represent and enforce rules around what kind of data can be stored in that column.

> **Domain/Constraint** is the rule and restrictions that we put on a database column, such as a datetime or a range of values, etc.

> **Degree** a theoretical term that describes how many columns a table has.

> **Row/Tuple** a single entry of data in a table that follows all the domains and constraints of the columns.

> **Cardinality** a theoretical term that describes how many rows are in a table.

> **Primary Key** a column/attribute of a row/tuple that can uniquely identify a single data entry.

> **Foreign Key** a primary key of another table that is used to describe a relationship between tables.

> **Online Transaction Processing \(OLTP\)** are the transactions that support day to day business. It is like our application storing data such as document information, or how in amazon you can add things to your cart.

> **Online Analytical Processing \(OLAP\)** supports the ability for a business to do data analytics and come up with answers and drive business decisions. Things like data science and machine learning can be pursued from this avenue.
